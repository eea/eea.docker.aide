# AIDE

__DEPRECATED__

> "Aide was the Basque numenistic deity of the air. She could manifest herself in both good (gentle breeze) and evil (storm wind) forms." wikipedia.org

This application is a frontend for [EEA Searchservices](https://github.com/eea/eea.docker.searchservices). It provides a *slice and dice* facetted search for Air emissions statistics reported to the European Environment Agency on behalf of the European Commission.

Node.js application + Docker env

## Development
1. Change code
2. If you:
  1. Want to change something in [eea.searchserver.js](https://github.com/eea/eea.searchserver.js):
     ```./build_dev.sh $PATH_TO_EEA_SEARCHSERVER_JS_REPO```
  2. If you changed ```Dockerfile``` or ```app/package.json```:
     ```docker build -t eeacms/aide:dev .``` and also make the changes in Dockerfile.dev.
  3. If you changed only something in './app' : go to step 3.
  4. If step 3 is still running and last build was made with ```./build_dev.sh```:
     go to step 4 because the server will automatically restart inside the container
  5. __Note:__ ```Dockerfile.dev``` builds only with ```./build_dev.sh``` because it temporarely adds
    eea.searchserver.js in the current directory.
3. ```docker-compose up```
4. Go to http://localhost:3000

If you want to check that the image is built correctly, please comment out
the ```volumes``` entry in ```docker-compose.yml```

## No Docker Development
1. ```cd app```
2. ```npm install```
3. Set ```elastic_*``` env variables
4. ```./app.js runserver```
5. Go to http://localhost:3000

## Production
1. ```docker pull eeacms/aide```
2. Use any orchestration solution and make sure that the container
   can ping the Elastic backend
3. Pass commands and env variables to the image as explained in the Docker Usage section
4. ##### Configure Apache/Nginx
 If the application is mapped under a path like: /data-and-maps/aide it needs to be redirected to /data-and-maps/aide/

	```
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} data-and-maps/aide$
	RewriteRule ^(.*[^/])$ $1/ [L,R=301]
	```

 * nginx:
	```
	location /data-and-maps/aide/ {
		proxy_pass http://hostRunningAIDEContainer:3000/
	}
	```

## Docker Usage

Basic usage of the image is given by the following pattern:

```
docker run -e elastic_host=$YOUR_ELASTIC_HOST run eeacms/aide $command
```

To see the available commands run:
```
docker run -e elastic_host=$YOUR_ELASTIC_HOST run eeacms/aide help
```

Available commands:
* create_index: create the index on elastic_host and start harvesting
* sync_index: recrate the index on the elastic_host and start harvesting
  https://www.elastic.co/blog/changing-mapping-with-zero-downtime
* reindex : recrate the index on the elastic_host and start harvesting
* remove_data: remove the ES index of this app
* remove_river: stop the harvesting process by removing the river

Environment variables:
* elastic_host, elastic_port, elastic_path: the elasticsearch endpoint parameters
  the elasticsearch endpoint will be interpreted as such: `http://$elastic_host:$elastic_port$elastic_path`
 * by default, elastic_port is 9200
 * by default, elastic_path is /
* NODE_ENV: can be either ```dev``` or ```production```
 * `dev` will do a more verbose logging
 * `production` will log only erros in an APACHE format
  * Assuming that the app will be proxied in production, the proxy app should contain the access logs

Note that any index creation commands require rights on the set elastic_backend
